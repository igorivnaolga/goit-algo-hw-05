# Task 1

Add a delete method to remove key-value pairs from the HashTable class.

# Task 2

Implement a binary search for a sorted array of floating-point numbers.
The function should return a tuple where:

The first element is the number of iterations needed to find the element.

The second element is the "upper bound" â€” the smallest element that is greater than or equal to the given value.

# Task 3

Compare the efficiency of three substring search algorithms:

Boyer-Moore

Knuth-Morris-Pratt

Rabin-Karp

Use two text files (e.g., Article 1 and Article 2) as the data source.

Using the timeit module, measure the execution time of each algorithm with:

A substring that actually exists in the text

A made-up substring that does not exist

Based on the results, determine which algorithm is the fastest for each text individually and overall.
